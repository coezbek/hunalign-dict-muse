Dictionaries for [hunalign](https://github.com/danielvarga/hunalign) generated from [Facebook MUSE dictionaries](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE#ground-truth-bilingual-dictionaries).

# How to manually update the files

In `bash` run `update.sh` to trigger a new download and conversion of the Facebook dictionaries. 

What happens during conversion:

* Removes the test and train subset files.
* Will rename `*.txt` to `*.dict`
* Will put the required delimiter `<space>@<space` into the files
* Reverse the order of the words, because `hunalign` expects the order to be `<target language> @ <source language>` (the reverse from the way the API and command line utility expect it)

**NOTE** The filename is `<source language>-<target language>.dict`
